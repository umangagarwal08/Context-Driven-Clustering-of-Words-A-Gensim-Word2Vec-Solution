# Word2Vec Model on Amazon Customer Reviews

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the Word2Vec library to build a word embedding model from customer reviews of phones and tablets purchased from Amazon. The objective is to train a model that captures semantic relationships between words based on the context in which they appear in the reviews. After training, the model is used to showcase word similarities and provide a list of similar words for given input words.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Amazon customer reviews for phones and tablets. Each review describes the customerâ€™s experience with the product, including aspects such as performance, usability, and design. The dataset is loaded and processed using `pandas` for use in the Word2Vec model.

## Project Structure
- **word2vec_model.py**: The script where the Word2Vec model is implemented and trained on the Amazon reviews dataset.
- **reviews_amazon.json**: The dataset containing customer reviews of phones and tablets purchased from Amazon.
- **README.md**: Project documentation (this file).

## Setup and Installation
    
1. **Install required libraries**:
    Make sure you have Python installed, and then install the necessary libraries using pip:
   
    pip install gensim pandas
    
    
3. **Download the dataset**:
   Ensure that the dataset file (reviews_amazon.json) is in the correct location.

## How It Works
1. **Load the Data**: The Amazon customer reviews dataset is loaded using pandas. Each review is preprocessed (e.g., tokenization, lowercasing) to prepare it for training the Word2Vec model.
  
2. **Train the Word2Vec Model**: The **gensim.models.Word2Vec** library is used to create and train a model on the customer review text data. The model learns word embeddings based on the context in which words appear in the reviews.

3. **Analyze Word Similarities**: After training the model, we use it to:
    - Find words similar to a given word based on their vector representations.
    - Measure the similarity between two words.

## Future Enhancements
- **Additional Preprocessing**: Implement more advanced preprocessing (e.g., removing stop words, handling contractions).
